The surrounding landscape was nearly leveled including the brand new ` + [secondaryStructures] + ` and the well-loved ` + [collateralDamage] + ` that was located across the street.

A person dressed in a ` + [disguise] + ` was seen leaving the scene in a `+ [modeOfTransportation] + `. witnesses said that the vehicle was very loud due to, what many believe was a ` + [mechanicalIssue] + `.

Before police could arrive, neighborhood hero ` + [superheroName]  + `had already ` + [methodOfEntry] + ` onto the scene. Among the rubble ` + [superheroName] + ` found a ` + [weapon] + ` which was immediately sent to the forensics lab for analysis.

    `We've had such lovely weather lately, now is the best time to make one of my favorites.

    Today we will be making the delicious "Bologna cake". This recipe has been requested by many of our followers, so we are finally bringing this crowd favorite to your home!
    
    This dish will require love and patience to make it turn out perfect.
    
    To start, you will need LOTS of Bologna.
    
    - Lay down a thick layer of Bologna so that the outside border forms a circle. You will need approximately
    12 slices of bologna per layer, add additional slices to accommodate for thinly sliced meats.
    - Once first layer has been placed and positioned on serving dish, add a nice thick layer of mayonnaise.
    - continue alternating layers of bologna n and mayonnaise until you have approximately seven layers of bologna.
    - "Ice" the cake with hearty helpings of mayonnaise. Decorate with your favorite mustard and dill flakes
    - chill for at least four hours and serve with strawberries
    
    This is one of my personal favorites, so I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!`,

    `With all the dreadful weather we've been having lately, now is a great time to remember to top off your blinker fluid.

    This is a very simple fix that can potentially save you lots of trouble later on down the road. 
    
    It's no secret that the newer model cars are really bad about maintaining blinker fluid pressure. There is no feeling worse than being stuck on the side of the road in a thunderstorm without functioning blinkers. 
    
    In addition to that police prefer that your blinkers be functioning correctly. That's why it's important to make sure the fluid stays topped off.
    
    On most models it's fairly easy to refill, just open the cap on the top and start pouring. You will know when there is enough because your feet will start getting wet. Feel free to lick any excess up because it's both healthy and tastes Great!
    
    Hope this reminder finds you well, and until
    tomorrow, 
    
    "Happy Blinking!"
