    `We've had such lovely weather lately, now is the best time to make one of my favorites.

    Today we will be making the delicious "Bologna cake". This recipe has been requested by many of our followers, so we are finally bringing this crowd favorite to your home!
    
    This dish will require love and patience to make it turn out perfect.
    
    To start, you will need LOTS of Bologna.
    
    - Lay down a thick layer of Bologna so that the outside border forms a circle. You will need approximately
    12 slices of bologna per layer, add additional slices to accommodate for thinly sliced meats.
    - Once first layer has been placed and positioned on serving dish, add a nice thick layer of mayonnaise.
    - continue alternating layers of bologna n and mayonnaise until you have approximately seven layers of bologna.
    - "Ice" the cake with hearty helpings of mayonnaise. Decorate with your favorite mustard and dill flakes
    - chill for at least four hours and serve with strawberries
    
    This is one of my personal favorites, so I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!`,

    `With all the dreadful weather we've been having lately, now is a great time to remember to top off your blinker fluid.

    This is a very simple fix that can potentially save you lots of trouble later on down the road. 
    
    It's no secret that the newer model cars are really bad about maintaining blinker fluid pressure. There is no feeling worse than being stuck on the side of the road in a thunderstorm without functioning blinkers. 
    
    In addition to that police prefer that your blinkers be functioning correctly. That's why it's important to make sure the fluid stays topped off.
    
    On most models it's fairly easy to refill, just open the cap on the top and start pouring. You will know when there is enough because your feet will start getting wet. Feel free to lick any excess up because it's both healthy and tastes Great!
    
    Hope this reminder finds you well, and until
    tomorrow, 
    
    "Happy Blinking!"

        `This morning citizens in the town of ` + cityName + ` were left reeling after the latest infraction by the ` + villainDescriptiveName + `. The villain better known as ` + userInput + `, had once again brought chaos and destruction through the heinous act of ` + currentCrime + `.
    
        ` + userInput + ` was at the regional ` + sceneOfCrime +  ` and was reported to be wearing a ` + disguise + ` and wielding a ` + weapon + `. For readers just joining us, ` + userInput + ` has been found guilty and charged by the state for ` + R1 + ` counts of ` + pastCrimes1 + `, as well as ` + R2 + `counts of ` + pastCrimes2 + `. Last month the federal judge issued a warrant for ` + userInput + `'s arrest.
        
        ` + userInput + ` clearly didn't learn the lesson because once again rampage and devastation were clearly the goal. With little regard for the surrounding witnesses, ` +  userInput +  ` seemed as though there was going to be no end to the binge of turmoil. It's been reported that ` + userInput + ` tried to flee the scene of the crime in a ` + modeOfTransportation + ` which failed to start due to faulty ` + mechanicalIssue + `.
        
        ` + userInput + `'s plans were soon interrupted when neighborhood hero ` + superheroName +  `showed up and immediately came to the defense of the innocent bystanders. ` + superheroName + ` quickly `+ methodOfEntry + ` into action. ` + superheroName + `began the engagement quickly, using the power of ` + powersList + `, ` + userInput + ` was easily overwhelmed. ` + superheroName + ` swooped in and went to ` + typeOfAttack + ` and ` + userInput + `'s mayhem quickly ended.
        
        As the stretcher was being loaded into the ambulance, ` + userInput + ` was heard to be yelling "` + villainQuotes + ` Once at the hospital, ` + userInput + ` was treated for one broken ` + bones1 + ` and two broken ` + bones2 + `.
        
        In the pandemonium, a ` + secondaryStructure + ` as well as a widely loved ` + collateralDamage + ` was destroyed. Citizens are planning a relief fund to help rebuild these icons of our lovely city.
        
        The town of ` + cityName + ` is once again safe thanks to ` + superheroName + `. When asked if he had anything to say to ` + userInput + `, ` + superheroName + ` responded by saying ` + herosRemarks + `.`,
    
        articleTwo :
        `Last night an explosion was reported near the old ` + sceneOfCrime + ` that was located at the edge of ` + cityName + `. The surrounding landscape was nearly leveled including the brand new ` + secondaryStructure + ` and the well-loved ` + collateralDamage + ` that was located across the street.
        
        A person dressed in a ` + disguise + ` was seen leaving the scene in a `+ modeOfTransportation + `. witnesses said that the vehicle was very loud due to, what many believe was a ` + mechanicalIssue + `.
        
        Before police could arrive, neighborhood hero ` + superheroName  + `had already ` + methodOfEntry + ` onto the scene. Among the rubble ` + superheroName + ` found a ` + weapon + ` which was immediately sent to the forensics lab for analysis.
        
        For our readers who are just joining, the ` + weapon + ` is the weapon of choice for the ` + villainDescriptiveName + ` better known as ` + userInput + `. ` + userInput + ` has previously been charged with four counts of ` + pastCrimes1 + ` and seven counts of ` + pastCrimes2 + `. Earlier this week, a federal judge issued a warrant for ` + userInput + `'s arrest on the charge of ` + currentCrime + `.
        
        `+ superheroName + ` vowed to use the awe inspiring ability of ` + powersList + ` to ` + typeOfAttack + ` and ` + breakWords + ` as many of `+ userInput + `'s ` + bones1 + ` as possible.
        
        ` + superheroName + ` spoke to reporters and made his thoughts clear when he said: "` + herosRemarks + `”
        
        We reached out to ` + userInput + ` and received a single response stating: "` + villainQuotes + `”
