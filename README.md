# ***The Daily Felon***

The Daily Felon began as a question, *"What am I going to do while sitting at the DMV for 15 minutes?"*. 

Since the very beggining of this project that question has driven us to strive, to perfect, and to even transcend, a 15 minute block of time wherever you are.

We asked ourselves *"What do people love?"*
We pondered *"What do people hate?"*

Then as if by the will of god, it struck us, people **LOVE** superheros, and they **HATE** criminals!

But how do we combine two things, so diametrically opposed? How do we showcase criminals without the general populus thinking that we support their amoral actions?

Suddenly another divine ray of inspiration broke through the clouds in our minds, and shown down from heaven.

## MUGSHOTS

The true encapsulation of rockbottom, the epicenter of despair, the photography of utter failure, the *mugshot*.

Criminals despise them, yellow belly white collar do gooders love gawking at them.

The asnwer was now clear.

## The answer

We would create a satirical newspaper that automatically generated silly news stories about random superheros apprehending criminals, with the heros (Using Marvel API) having a caulous disregard for appropriate use of force, and randomly selected mugshots of the alleged perpetrator (Using JailBase API).

In our DEEP and EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL research this perfect combination of sugar and spice, proved to be just enough to waste 15 minutes of your life.

## Personal Growth over the course of the project

- I think we all have a new appreciation of the work superheros do
- We improved our overall capabilities with API's
- Our team mangement skills were fleshed out quite a bit more
- I mean gosh golly we just had a good time
